![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/rodolfobandeira/docker-share-files/workflows/Docker%20Image%20CI/badge.svg)

#### Description:

This Docker repository starts an HTTP server on port 8080 (http://localhost:8080) showing the famous "index of" listing all files from the local folder `./shared-files`. It is a great way to quickly share files through the network. You can get your private IP with `ifconfig`(MacOS/Linux/*BSD) or`ipconfig`(Windows).

**How it really works:**

This docker uses the official Nginx docker image based on Alpine Linux. I decided to use Alpine because it packs everything that you need on just 18MB. :sunglasses:
When `docker-compose up` is called via command line, it creates two volumes that is shared between the Docker container and host machine. 
The first volume makes the connection between a local folder and your Docker container. That means, if you add a new file inside `./shared-folder`, it will be available automatically on the web interface. (Of course you need to reload the page).
The second volume make possible you customize the Nginx config. That being said, it points `./config/default.conf` to `/usr/share/nginx/html` 

We have two folders under this project:

shared-folder | config
------------ | -------------
Just add any file here and when you start your docker, they will be listed to anyone download it | Here we have our Nginx `default.conf` file. Wherever you change here, will be reflected inside your docker. After changing something, keep in mind that you will need to restart your Nginx, so the easiest way is just restarting your docker container.
If you add an `index.html` your "index of" feature will be gone. Sometimes could be useful. Did I mention that you also can create subfolders here? | `./config/default.conf` points to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`. The same way, `./shared-folder` points to (Docker) `/usr/share/nginx/html` folder.

`./config/default.conf`:

```nginx
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  localhost;

    location / {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index  index.html index.htm;
        autoindex on;
    }

    error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }
}
```

`./docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
    web:
        build: .
        volumes:
            - ./config/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
            - ./shared-folder:/usr/share/nginx/html
        ports:
- 8080:80
```

##### Lets see this working:

1) `git clone https://github.com/rodolfobandeira/docker-share-files.git`

2) `docker-compose build`

3) `docker-compose up`

Open your browser and try the address: `http://localhost:8080`. You must see something like this:
